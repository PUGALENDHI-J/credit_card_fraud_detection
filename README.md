# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
### Machine Learning based Intelligent Fraud Detection System

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning and provides an interactive user interface using **Streamlit**.  
Users can upload transaction data, and the model analyzes and predicts whether the transactions are **Fraud** or **Legitimate**, along with fraud percentage and alerts.
