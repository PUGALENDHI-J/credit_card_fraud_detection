# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
### Machine Learning based Intelligent Fraud Detection System

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning and provides an interactive user interface using **Streamlit**.  
Users can upload transaction data, and the model analyzes and predicts whether the transactions are **Fraud** or **Legitimate**, along with fraud percentage and alerts.

🎨 Note About UI / Theme Difference

The colorful landing page design shown in screenshots is from the local custom UI version, which includes additional styling and animations.
Streamlit Cloud automatically applies its default dark theme UI, so the live hosted version may look visually different, but functionality remains the same and fully operational.

The colorful UI seen in screenshots is from the local HTML/CSS version.
The deployed Streamlit version uses default Streamlit theming due to limited CSS support in Streamlit Cloud
